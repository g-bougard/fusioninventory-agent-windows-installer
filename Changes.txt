* win32: Fix service memory leak due to Win32::Daemon module

  perl fork with thread emulation under win32 and preserve a little memory usage.
* win32: wait service control manager is ready before really starting the service
* logger: don't use File::stat module to just get logfile file size, better use -s
  as File::stat module seems to fail in rare case.

  after download, parts retention is reset to the same delay for all file parts,
  so the retention duration applies at the time parts has been downloaded

  any busy or not responding peers in a more acceptable delay.
* For better P2P support, agent ajusts its 404 message to "Nothing found" when it
  has nothing to share with other agents. So peers won't ask again and again for
  any file part during 20 minutes by default.
* Bump NetDiscovery task version to 2.6
* Bump NetInventory task version to 3.0
